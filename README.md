SeqSeq9
=======

### The Sound
[Here](http://youtu.be/YKb0v2ULtwU) is a collection of recent performances. All sounds are Logic X instruments and generally use a factory patch without post production. The sequences are a synthesis of human and machine. The drum patterns are always man made.

### History
This is the ninth generation of a sequencer-sequencer. Described as an experiment in computer aided jazz. It was supposed to yield fame and fortune. But all it gave were tones.

### Theory
Jazz is produced by improvisation around a theme. Seqseq9 expects a theme to be provided in realtime via midi, to which it responds with realtime midi. A human player is expected to do the same. While playing togther they should feed each other and discover musical things, in realtime, and in a manner pleasurable to an audience. That's the daydream, anyway.

### Practice vs. Experience
Earlier versions of this system suffered from feature creep. Endless small 'adjustments' to the code result in a finely tuned emitter of amusicality. It's difficult to keep the generator free of complexity. The goal is to produce a device with a very small number of inputs and large output of beauty. 

### Previous Results
Several prototypes preceed this version, and more will likely follow. They are generally abandoned once the complexity is too high. All eventually suffer code rot and are not easily revived. But their outputs were recorded.

- 'Feelers' Developed in Chicago. Experimentally interactive and very clumsy. Weird music. [Album](https://soundcloud.com/feelersoutput)
- 'Manandjazz' Developed in Lilongwe. Interactive but unfriendly. Uses webaudio without midi. [Album](https://github.com/abrie/seqseq9/blob/master/album/manandjazz-live_in_lilongwe.tgz?raw=true).
