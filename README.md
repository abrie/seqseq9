SeqSeq9
=======

### History
This is the ninth generation of a sequencer-sequencer. Described as an experiment in computer aided jazz. It was supposed to yield fame and fortune. But all it made were tones.

### Theory
Jazz is produced when a player improvises around a theme. Seqseq nine expects a theme to be provided via midi, and outputs 'jazz' as a result. The player and the machine should discover musical things together, in realtime, and in a manner pleasurable to an audience.

### Practice and Experience
Earlier versions of this system suffered from feature creep. Endless small 'adjustments' to the code result in a finely tuned emitter of amusicality. The dream is to produce a device with a very small number of inputs and large output of beauty. 

### Previous Results
A number of previous prototypes have been produced. They have all suffered code rot and are not easily revived. Outputs from the last two versions are provided below:

- 'Feelers' a system composed of Cocoa backend with an AngularJS frontend. Developed in Chicago. Clumsy interface. Weird music.
- 'Manandjazz' the first interactive system. Developed in Lilongwe. Does not use midi.
- 'SeqSeq9' used Apple's Logic as the front end; but could use any sequencer. Developed in Brampton.
