SeqSeq9
=======

### The Sound
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKb0v2ULtwU&list=PLqyn9JJjwfUN4gW2cIPBj_nkkEg7kbyLx) are logs of various performances. They reflect various algorithmic experiments and were selected by their ability to induce [frission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_chill) in the author. All sounds are made by Logic X instruments and generally use a factory patch. The sequences are a synthesis of human and machine, but the drum patterns are man made.

### The Code
The code, as presented, is a framework for experimentation and may not be very useful to third parties. No instructions are provided because it is presently too dynamic. It is a sandbox for the discovery of algorithmic approaches amendable to an interactive application. This repository is thus a log for future reference.

### History
Here is the ninth generation of a sequencer-sequencer. Described as an experiment in computer aided jazz. It was supposed to yield fame and fortune. But all it gave were tones. Nonetheless it continues to feed flights of unreasonable fancy.

### Theory
Jazz is defined as improvisation around a theme. SeqSeq9 expects a theme via realtime midi, to which it responds by producing realtime midi. Imagine a duet as an analogy. Players playing together could inspire one another and discover musical things, in realtime, and in a manner pleasurable to an audience. That's the daydream, anyway.

### Practice vs. Experience
Earlier versions of this system suffered from feature creep. Endless small 'adjustments' to the code result in a finely tuned emitter of amusicality. Complexity seems to arise from too many specific changes. The goal is to produce a device with a very small number of inputs and large output of beauty. It seems reasonable that a simple machine could be capable of complex beauty, especially if coupled to a human. 

### Previous Results
Several prototypes preceed this version, and more will likely follow. They are generally abandoned once the complexity is too high. All eventually suffer code rot and are not easily revived. But their outputs were recorded.

- 'Feelers' Developed in Chicago. Experimentally interactive and very clumsy. Weird music. [Album](https://soundcloud.com/feelersoutput)
- 'Manandjazz' Developed in Lilongwe. Interactive but unfriendly. Uses webaudio without midi. [Album](https://github.com/abrie/seqseq9/blob/master/album/manandjazz-live_in_lilongwe.tgz?raw=true).
